Policy simulations refer to the use of models, often computer-based, to analyze the potential outcomes or effects to different policies before they are implemented in the real world. These simulations help policymakers, analysts, and researchers 
understand the potential consequences, impacts, and interactions of policy changes within a controlled environment. 
Here's an overview of how policy simulations work :

1. Modelling : Analysts construct models that represent the complex interactions within a particular system or environment. These models can range from simple mathematical equations to sophisticated computer simulations that incorporate various
factors and variables.

2. Input parameters : Relevant data and input parameters are fed into the model. These parameters can include economic indicators, demographic information, historical trends, behavioral patterns, and more, depending on the specific policy area being
simulated.

3. Policy scenarios : different policy scenarios or changes are introduced into the model. For instance, changes in taxation, healthcare policies, environmetal regulations, trade policies, or infrastructure investments can be simulated to observe
their potential effects.
